I was joined this project as a front-end developer, my task was to create an Equality Inc website using Weebly platform. The challenge was to adapt existing templates to custome design. 
<br><br>

I did it by adding some code to core files what created additional containers that I was able to style according to design.
<br><br>
Here is what Alice Marshall, founder at Equality Inc said about working with me:<br>
<q>
Maria has been an excellent and talented asset to my team at Equality Inc. She programmed and created my website on the Weebly platform, not based on a template but rather on a custom design. She helped me troubleshoot any problems that came up in the process, and test the site too. She helped me find a good e-mail marketing system for my site, and she also helped with the crafting of my follow-up email system. She helped with the overall marketing strategy for the site. Her exceptional ability to learn new things quickly, as well as be responsive, have been invaluable to me.
